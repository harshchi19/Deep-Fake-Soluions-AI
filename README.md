## Features
- **Image Fake Detection**: Upload an image to determine its authenticity.
- **Account Fake Detection**: Check the authenticity of account details.
- **Audio Fake Detection**: Upload an audio file to detect manipulations.
- **Fake News Detection**: Input text to verify its authenticity.
- **Detailed Model Information**: Insights into the models used for detection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- git (for cloning the repository)

### Clone Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/harshchi19/Deep-Fake-Soluions-AI.git
    ```

### Create Virtual Environment
2. Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

### Activate Virtual Environment
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

### Install Dependencies
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Run Application
5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the web application in your browser. The default address is `http://localhost:8501`.
2. Use the sidebar to select the task you want to perform (Image, Account, Audio, or News Fake Detection).
3. Follow the instructions provided for each task to upload files or input data.
4. Click on the 'Predict' or 'Check' button to get the results.
